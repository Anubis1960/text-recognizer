# Text Recognizer

This repository contains code to train and evaluate models for text recognition. 
The models are trained using three datasets: two for digit recognition (MNIST and [Swiss Notation Digits](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olafkrastovski/handwritten-digits-0-9/data)), and 
one for character recognition ([based on NIST and NMIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinpatel21/az-handwritten-alphabets-in-csv-format/data)).

The loss curves for the model:
